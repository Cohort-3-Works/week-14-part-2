## Extends and implements are two very different things

extends are a object oriented phenomena

if i have a class call shape which will have a function call area then i can create two new classes that extends the class with function area

for better understanding

## extend also give the power of super function

means we get everything from the parent class with the power of implementation too

means if a class has some function area and using that class we extended another class rec then we can do rec.area

obviously the father will get created before the child for better understanding .
